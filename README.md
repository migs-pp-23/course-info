# Python Projects - MIGS - Autumn 2023

Welcome to Python Projects!

This course introduces fundamental principles of computer programming using the Python language, and explores some of its applications in solving mathematics problems. Worksheets will be delivered in the form of interactive **Jupyter notebooks**, and provide examples and exercises to practice coding and mathematical computing skills.

This is a short course, written for students with perhaps some previous programming experience but it does not assume prior knowledge of Python. (For students who have programmed in Python it serves as a useful refresher).

If you have any questions or issues about the course content, please email me!

# Course information

## Course structure

The course will take place over 5 weeks, starting Tuesday 19th September 2023. The course material will be released online in GitHub repositories.

In each of the first 2 weeks, you will work through a set of **interactive worksheets** with examples and exercises. You are expected to complete the worksheets in your own time. You will also have to take a quiz consisting of a few Python programming questions each week.

Alternatively, if you already have lots of experience with Python, you can instead choose to start exploring a project individually (on a different topic from your group project choice).

The last 2 weeks will be dedicated to the completion of a group project.

There will be **a drop-in session every week on Tuesdays** for Q&A and support, happening in Bayes 5.46 -- see "Schedule" below.

- The first two sessions are not mandatory to attend, but I strongly encourage you to come if you have any questions or would like to chat about Python.
- The last two sessions will be for you to work on the projects with your group.

## Assessment structure

To gain credit for the course, you must score at least 50% on the 2 quizzes, and complete a final project with your group.

The projects will be assessed on a pass/fail basis by a 15-min presentation (+ Q&A), on Tuesday 24th October, starting at 10am in 5.46 Bayes.

Here is a suggested structure for your presentation:

- Introduce your project topic, and state the specific problem/question you have tackled. (2min)
- Explain the method you have used to solve the problem; it could be useful to illustrate it with a simple example and/or some useful visualisations produced in Python. (3-5min)
- Deep dive: choose a part of your code which you found interesting and/or challenging to implement, or maybe a part which taught you something new about Python, and walk the audience through your code to explain what you did. This doesn't necessarily have to be the "core" part of your code, or the part where the main computations happen -- it could also be a utility function you wrote to visualise your results or clean up your data, for instance. (3-5min)
- Present your final results and conclude. (2-3min)

## Schedule

The live sessions will happen on Tuesdays, and the material for each week will be released on Wednesdays. Quizzes will be due on Fridays.

## Jupyter notebooks

Worksheets are viewed and edited in a web browser, but access to a Jupyter server is required in the background to perform the computations.

Instructions are provided [here](SetupInstructions.md) for how to install **git** and **Anaconda**, a popular Python distribution for scientists. Anaconda comes with Jupyter, which allows you to run a Jupyter server on your computer, and Spyder, a Python IDE.

If you are interested in setting up virtual environments (optional), instructions are provided [here](Environments.md).

## Coderunner

The 2 quizzes are set up on Coderunner, and accessed through Learn. Each quiz will consist of a number of programming questions, which will be automatically graded. You will be asked to write Python code to perform specific tasks, and your code will be tested against a number of inputs to check that the correct output is returned for all tests.
